1- First i thought this is a base64 string because of the '=' in the end of string (**R[corrupted]BR3tCNDUzXzYxWDdZXzRSfQ==**)

2- I went to this website [Base64 Decode/Encode][base64].

[base64]: https://www.base64decode.org/ "Base64 Decode/Encode"

3- I tried to delete "R[corrupted]" but i got nothing
