1- I downloaded the word file

2- I tried to read or understand any thing but i got nothing

3- So i went to google and i found a command to print any readable string in eny file (**strings**)

4- I used this command to print readable string and -n to make the length in 32 becuase of md5 formated in 32 hexadecimal digits.

Then i got this flag (**877c1fa0445adaedc5365d9c139c5219**).
